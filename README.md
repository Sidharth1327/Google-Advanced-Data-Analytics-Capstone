### About the company
Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Its global workforce of over 100,000 employees research, design, construct, validate, and distribute electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifortâ€™s end-to-end vertical integration model has made it a global leader at the intersection of alternative energy and automobiles.       

### Understanding the business scenario and problem:
As part of an initiative to enhance employee satisfaction levels, the HR department at Salifort Motors sought data analytics expertise to analyze employee data. The objective was to identify potential factors that could lead to employee attrition within the company. A data analytics professional was tasked with conducting the analysis and providing data-driven recommendations based on the insights gained from the employee data.

Goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

Predicting employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.

### Objectives :
1.How to increase employee retention.

2.Building the most effective model to predict employee departure.

3.Analyze the key factors driving employee turnover.

4.Share recommendations for next steps with the leadership team.
